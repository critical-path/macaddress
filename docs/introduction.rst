Media access control (MAC) addresses play an important role in local-area networks.  They also pack a lot of information into 48-bit hexadecimal strings!

The macaddress library makes it easy to evaluate the properties of MAC addresses and the `extended identifiers <https://standards.ieee.org/products-services/regauth/tut/index.html>`__ of which they are subclasses.
